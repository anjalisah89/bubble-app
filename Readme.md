# Bubble App

This is a simple bubble app that allows you to create a new bubble and add it to the list of bubbles. You can also delete a bubble from the list.

This was created for the assignment provided by `CanvasJS` for the `Software Developer` position by **Anjali Sah**.

This is made using Basic `HTML` and `JavaScript`.

## Running the app
Since this does not require any extra resource except for static HTML and JS files, you can run this app by simply opening the `index.html` file in any modern browser.

## Features
- Create a new bubble
- Delete a bubble
- Clicking on a bubble will send the arrow to that bubble changing it's color
- Reset the canvas
